        <h3>#1: People</h5>
        <img src="M:\my_web_files\activity1\baseball.jpg" alt="Two baseball teammates, a catcher and a pitcher, practicing" width="275" height="400">
        <p>With the alt text of these two teammates, I mainly wanted to convey that there were only two of them, they were teammates,
            they were currently in their positions, and that they were practicing.  I chose not to mention the details of their uniforms because I don't think it's vital for the 
            user to know in order to understand what is happening in this picture.  <em>Image Source: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-in-red-jersey-shirt-and-white-pants-standing-on-baseball-field-5184710/" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-in-red-jersey-shirt-and-white-pants-standing-on-baseball-field-5184710/</a></em>

            <h3>#2: Text</h5>
            <img src="M:\my_web_files\activity1\encouragement.jpg" alt="On the right page of an open journal, in fancy, large text, is written 'Don't wish for it.  Work for it.'">
            <p>With how the prominent the 'Don't wish for it. Work for it.' text was, I thought that it was most important to write the alt text to reflect that.  I also wanted to highlight the font style being a little more fancy
                than just plain printed English.  The text that's on the left page, the mock calendar, didn't have any relevance to the main text, so I didn't even mention it. <em>Image Source: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/dont-wish-for-it-work-for-it-calligraphy-1074920/" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/dont-wish-for-it-work-for-it-calligraphy-1074920/</a></em>

        <h3>#3: Other</h3>
        <img src="M:\my_web_files\activity1\blueberry.jpg" alt="A blueberry bush full of both blue, ripe berries and pink, unripe berries" height="350" width="600">
        <p>I didn't describe color with the alt text on the other two images, but I thought it was crucial to describe the color of the berries, since the different colors have different meanings.  I didn't describe the color of the bush itself 
            since it's generally understood that bushes are mostly green, and if there was an exception, I would've described the color of the bush as well. <em>Image Source: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-blueberries-on-the-tree-8754403/" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-blueberries-on-the-tree-8754403/</a></em>

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p><strong>#1: People:</strong> I think the most critical parts of the image are that the two baseball players are teammates, they're practicing together,
        and that they are in specific positions.  I wouldn't change these no matter what becuase I believe them to be the most prominent parts of the image that a person 
        looking at the image would need to understand the most.  I definitely could've been more descriptive about the jerseys the baseball players were wearing, including color and material.
        That would be useful if the website was selling baseball jerseys and the customer needed to know what kind of color and material was for sale.  I chose not to include it 
        here because the focus of the image was on what sport the teammates were playing, and that they were practicing.  I could've gotten away with not describing what positions they were in, and just saying they were practicing together.
        Regardless, I chose to include it because of how the image was taken to emphasize the two players in their different positions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>#2: Text:</strong>Without a doubt, the main text HAS to stay in the alt text since it's the entire point of the image.  It's literally in the center, so it's meant to be seen. I could've described the paper the text was on, along with
        the table and contents of the other page, but thought it better not to because I interpreted it as filler to make the image seem more 'complete'.  It had no relevance to the main text, so it didn't make sense for me to waste time on it, or have someone
        with a screen reader waste time on something that was only filler. I didn't have to be as descriptive as I was about the font of the text or that the text was contained in a journal of sorts.  I chose to describe the font as it was directly related 
        to the presentation of the main text.  </p>
        
        <p><strong>#3: Other:</strong> Because this is a landscape/object shot, I thought it was important to describe the color and ripeness of the blueberries.  There's a large difference between the look of a ripe blueberry
        and a blueberry that hasn't ripened yet, and I thought it best to describe that.  I could've been more descriptive about the bush/branches the berries were hanging off of.  It could be useful if I was describing a picture of the 
        entire blueberry farm, but since I was focused on the blueberries themselves, I just wanted to focus on the blueberries.  Besides, it's generally understood that bushes are green and that blueberries only blossom in the summer.  
        I could've avoided mentioning the unripened blueberries, since the clearer parts of the image mostly show the ripened berries on the bush.  I chose to describe it because there were still unripened berries on that bush, and I wanted to paint
        a clearer picture to the user of what exactly the image was, rather than just ripe berries. </p>
