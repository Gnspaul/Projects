    <p>Alice in Chains are a massive force made from the early grunge scene that exploded in Seattle in the 90's which also included Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Nirvana.  The first of these four bands to crack the mainstream, their debut album '<em>Facelift</em>' and successive
      albums '<em>Dirt</em>', self-titled '<em>Alice in Chains</em>', and their EP '<em>Jar of Flies</em>' catapulted them into fame.  Distinguished by original lead singer Layne Staley's harmonization with singer/guitarist Jerry Cantrell, Alice in Chains became known for their two singer 
      performances along with their heavy metal influences.  Alice in Chains have influenced countless extremely famous bands, including Metallica, Avenged Sevenfold, Breaking Benjamin, Opeth, and Dream Theater. They have been nominated for 11 Grammy awards and have sold 40 mllion albums worldwide.  The current line-up is (from left to right):
