    <h1>Welcome to the Merch Store!</h1>
    <h2>Your one stop shop for the hottest Metallica, Allegaeon, and Alice in Chains merch/music!</h2>
    <p>My name is Gavin Spaulding, and I am an amateur in web designing.  I based this website off of three of my favorite bands, whose logos you can see below.  I hope you enjoy looking through it as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: None of these designs, logos, or albums are mine, all rights go to the bands and their own merchandise websites. &copy; Metallica, Allegaeon, Alice in Chains.</p>
